# Transformer from Scratch in Go

This project demonstrates how to build a Transformer model from scratch using the Go programming language. The focus is on understanding and implementing the core components of the Transformer architecture, typically used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks like text encoding and decoding.

## Overview

This project implements the fundamental building blocks of a Transformer model, a key architecture in deep learning, particularly in NLP. While Go is not traditionally used for machine learning or deep learning tasks, this project showcases the flexibility of the language and the power of learning by re-implementing core concepts in a different programming environment.

## Features

- **Text Encoding**: Converts text into a sequence of integers representing unique characters.
- **Custom Transformer Components**: Implementation of basic components of a Transformer such as self-attention, feedforward layers, and positional encoding.
- **Tensor Operations**: Use of `Gorgonia` for tensor operations, akin to how tensors are handled in PyTorch.
- **Basic Data Processing**: Encoding and decoding of text data, and visualization of model outputs.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.16+**: The project requires Go, preferably the latest version.
- **Gorgonia**: A machine learning library for Go, used for tensor operations and building the computational graph.
- **git**: For cloning the repository.

## Installation

1. **Install Go**: If you don't have Go installed, download and install it from [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).
   
2. **Set up the project**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformer-go.git
    cd transformer-go
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    go get -u gorgonia.org/gorgonia
    go get -u gorgonia.org/tensor
    ```

## Usage

1. **Running the Example**:
    - To run the main program that demonstrates the encoding of text and building of a tensor:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

2. **Encoding Text**:
    - The `encode` function converts text into a sequence of integers based on the characters present.
    
3. **Tensor Operations**:
    - The project uses `Gorgonia` for handling tensor operations, similar to PyTorch in Python.

4. **Experiment**:
    - Modify `main.go` to include more advanced components of the Transformer, such as self-attention and feedforward layers.
    - Implement different text datasets or tasks like language modeling.
